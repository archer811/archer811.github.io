希望从此养成写博客的习惯

下面加首歌激烈下自己
Charlie Puth 写了《Look at me now》,之后一年发布了see you again成功让全世界人都知道他，就像歌词写的一样：

I said this time next year
I’m gonna be the one to do
Everything and more you said I couldn’t do
This one is for you
This time next year
I’m gonna be stronger
A little bit taller
Top is my only view

I can’t get in the door now
Better get out of my way
Never really saw me coming
You left with nothing to say
This is for everybody
Who always put me down
I hope you open up your eyes
And take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me now
希望自己努力再努力一点
